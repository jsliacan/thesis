\chapter{Abstract}
A permutation class is a set of permutations closed under taking subpermutations. We study two aspects of permutation classes: enumeration and packing.

Our work on enumeration consists of two campaigns. First, we enumerate all juxtaposition classes of the form ``$\Av(abc)$ next to $\Av(xy)$'', where $abc$ and $xy$ are permutations of lengths three and two, respectively. We represent elements from such a juxtaposition class by Dyck paths decorated with sequences of points. Context-free grammars are then used to enumerate these decorated Dyck paths. Second, we classify as algebraic the generating functions of $1\times m$ permutation grid classes where one cell is context-free and the remaining cells are monotone. We rely on properties of combinatorial specifications of context-free classes and use operators to express juxtapositions. Repeated application of operators resolves cases for $m>2$. We provide examples to re-prove known results and give new ones. Our methods are algorithmic and could be implemented on a PC.

Our work on packing consolidates current knowledge about packing densities of 4-point permutations. We also improve the lower bounds for the packing densities of 1324 and 1342 and provide rigorous upper bounds for the packing densities of 1324, 1342, and 2413. All our bounds are within $10^{-4}$ of the true packing densities. Together with the known bounds, we have a fairly complete picture of 4-point packing densities. Additionally, we obtain several bounds (lower and upper) for permutations of length at least five. Our main tool for the upper bounds is the framework of flag algebras introduced by Razborov in 2007. We also present Permpack --- a flag algebra package for permutations.

\chapter{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisor Robert Brignall for finding nice balance between guidance and freedom. I especially valued the opportunity to pursue side projects with little or no relationship to my thesis without the pressure of producing measurable results. It made mathematics more enjoyable. Thank you.

My acknowledgements go to the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at The Open University for funding my PhD and providing support in various forms throughout the past three years.

Special thanks go to my office mates who tolerated my smelly running clothes as well as my constant chewing in our office: Grahame Erskine, Michael Ewetola, Jay Fraser, and Olivia Jeans. I am particularly grateful to David Bevan for his welcome when I first came to the department, for maths conversations and help. Thanks also go to Lax Chan, Argyris Christodoulou, Ioannis Dourekas, Vasso Evdoridou, Matthew Jacques, Robert Lewis, Alison Maidment, David Marchant, Maha Moustafa, David Mart\'{i}-Pete, Tony Royle, Margaret Stanier, Brigitte Stenhouse, and James Tuite.

Additionally, I would like to thank my co-authors, collaborators, and influences outside of my department: Dan Kr\'a\v{l}, Oleg Pikhurko, Jozef Skokan, Kostas Tyros, Walter Stromquist, and Michael Albert.

Thanks also go to my parents and Veronika for being supportive throughout.

Lastly, I thank Fiona who helps me stay mathematically curious.

\chapter{Declarations}
There are five chapters in this thesis.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Chapter~\ref{chap:general_intro} consists of a general exposition of the area of permutation patterns and the two viewpoints of the area that we take in this thesis: enumeration and packing. Most of the text in this chapter follows parts of the comprehensive exposition in Bevan's thesis~\cite{bevan2015thesis}.
\item Chapter~\ref{chap:catalanjuxt} consists of joint work with Robert Brignall. The corresponding paper~\cite{brignallsliacanjuxt} is published in \emph{Electronic Journal of Combinatorics}. We use PermLab~\cite{albertpermlab}, Mathematica~\cite{mathematica} and Sage~\cite{sagemath} for computations.
\item Chapter~\ref{chap:iterjuxt} consists of joint work with Robert Brignall. We use PermLab~\cite{albertpermlab} and Mathematica~\cite{mathematica} for our computations.
\item Chapter~\ref{chap:packsmall} consists of joint work with Walter Stromquist. The corresponding paper~\cite{sliacanstromquistpacking} is published in \emph{Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science} in \emph{Permutation Patterns 2016} special issue. We make use of: Flagmatic package~\cite{flagmatic}, Mathematica~\cite{mathematica}, Sage~\cite{sagemath}, and Permpack~\cite{permpack}.
\item Chapter~\ref{chap:permpack} consists of a description of Permpack that the author wrote for the work in Chapter~\ref{chap:packsmall}. It was written to resemble Flagmatic to make it easier to use alongside Flagmatic. No Flagmatic code was used, nor were any algorithms taken into Permpack. Permpack is a Sage~\cite{sagemath} package.
\end{enumerate}
None of the results appear in any other thesis and all co-authors have agreed with inclusion of joint work in this thesis.
